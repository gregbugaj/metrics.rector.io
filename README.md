We have a variety of components to help us measuring performance indicators of our application:

Apdex        : Application Performance Index 
Gauges       : A gauge allows an instant measurement of a value.
Counters     : A counter is is a gauge for an AtomicLong instance and adds convenience methods to increment or decrement its value.
Meters       : A meter is used to measure the rate of events over time.
Histograms   : A histogram allows us to measure the statistical distribution of values in a stream of data.
Timers       : A timer allows us to measure the rate that a piece of code is called and the distribution of its duration.
